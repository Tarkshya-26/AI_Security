# AI SUPPLY CHAIN Security

![image.png](AI%20SUPPLY%20CHAIN%20Security/image.png)

Now that we understand traditional software supply chains, let's examine how AI introduces an entirely new dimension of risk.

## **From Code to Models**

Traditional software supply chains deal primarily with **code** (including libraries, frameworks, and packages written by developers). AI supply chains add a fundamentally different type of artefact: **trained models**.

A trained model is not just code. It is the product of an architecture (the neural network structure), training data (potentially millions of examples), a training process (the settings and hardware configuration), and serialised weights (the learned parameters saved to a file). Think of serialised weights like a saved game state: when you save your progress in a video game, the file captures everything about where you are (your position, inventory, completed quests). Model weights work similarly. They capture everything the model "learned" during training. Now imagine downloading that save file from a stranger. It loads correctly, your character has the right stats, and the game plays as expected. But the person has access to every byte and could have embedded something alongside the legitimate data that stays invisible. Until it matters!.

![Model Weights Analogy: Like Game Save Files](https://cdn-images.tryhackme.com/user-uploads/69650d18bb3fe8c456972924/room-content/69650d18bb3fe8c456972924-1775119063048.png)

*The save loaded correctly. In the corner, quietly, something else did too.*

When you download a pre-trained model, you are trusting all four of these elements, most of which you cannot inspect or verify. Unlike traditional code, which runs as written, pickle-based model files contain **serialised objects** that can execute code the moment you call `model.load()`.

## **Why This Matters: Transfer Learning**

Most teams download a model someone else has already trained and adapt it to their own task, a technique called **transfer learning**. The most common approach is **fine-tuning**: this involves adjusting the model's weights on a smaller, task-specific dataset. A team can fine-tune in hours rather than train from scratch over weeks, but this creates a fundamental security tension: **you are building your application on top of weights trained by an unknown party, on unknown data, using processes you cannot verify.**

Research has shown that backdoors inserted during pre-training can **survive fine-tuning**. An attacker who poisons a popular base model does not just compromise one application; they compromise every downstream application that fine-tunes from it.

Modern fine-tuning methods like **LoRA** let teams share small **adapter** files that bolt onto a base model to modify its behaviour. Your supply chain now has two trust dependencies: the base model and the adapter. A clean base model paired with a malicious adapter is still a compromised model.

![Transfer Learning Risk: Inherited Backdoors](https://cdn-images.tryhackme.com/user-uploads/69650d18bb3fe8c456972924/room-content/69650d18bb3fe8c456972924-1775119063141.png)

*Fine-tuning adapts the behaviour. It cannot remove what was baked in during pre-training.*

## **The Four Components**

An AI supply chain consists of four key components. Each introduces its own trust relationships and attack surfaces.

![AI Supply Chain as Conveyor Belt](https://cdn-images.tryhackme.com/user-uploads/69650d18bb3fe8c456972924/room-content/69650d18bb3fe8c456972924-1775147665819.png)

*Your application trusts the entire supply chain. One malicious component among thousands of legitimate ones is all it takes.*

| **Component** | **What It Is** | **Where It Comes From** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Models** | Pre-trained weights and architectures | Hugging Face Hub, TensorFlow Hub, PyTorch Hub | `bert-base-uncased`, `gpt2` |
| **Datasets** | Training and evaluation data | Hugging Face Datasets, Kaggle, academic repositories | ImageNet, Common Crawl |
| **Frameworks** | ML libraries that train and run models | PyPI, conda, GitHub | PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn |
| **Dependencies** | Supporting packages the frameworks rely on | PyPI, npm, conda-forge | NumPy, SciPy, Pillow, tokenizers |

## **The Architecture**

Here is how these components fit together in a typical ML deployment:

![AI Supply Chain Architecture](https://cdn-images.tryhackme.com/user-uploads/69650d18bb3fe8c456972924/room-content/69650d18bb3fe8c456972924-1775119063084.png)

*Every arrow connects a component you depend on but did not build.*

Every arrow in this diagram represents a **trust relationship**. Your application trusts the framework. The framework trusts the package registry. The registry trusts whoever uploaded the package. If any of these trust relationships is broken, the entire system is compromised.

Not every AI supply chain looks the same. There are two fundamentally different ways organisations consume AI models, and each creates a different risk profile.

## **Paradigm 1: Downloading Model Files**

This is the traditional approach, where you download pre-trained weights (`.pkl`, `.safetensors`, `.pt`, `.gguf`, etc.) from a repository like Hugging Face and load them into your own infrastructure. You are responsible for hosting, inference, and security.

In this paradigm, everything you load crosses your trust boundary and runs on your own systems. The file format determines which risks are in play. `.pkl`, `.pt`, and `.bin` files use Python's pickle serialisation, which can execute arbitrary code the moment a file is loaded. `.safetensors` eliminates that risk by storing only raw weight values with no executable code. `.h5` is the native format for Keras, a popular deep learning framework: not pickle-based, but it can contain executable architecture-level code embedded in the model's layers. `.gguf`, the dominant format for running local large language models such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen, is not pickle-based and does not carry a serialisation exploit. Weight-level attacks and backdoors still apply to GGUF files, however.

GGUF models are almost always quantised. Quantisation compresses a model's weights from full precision (32-bit floating-point) to lower precision (4- or 8-bit integers), reducing file size so large models can run on consumer hardware. If a third party performed that compression, the quantisation step is itself an unverified point in the supply chain: you are trusting not just the original training but every transformation the file went through before reaching you. The [Supply Chain Attack Vectors](https://tryhackme.com/room/supplychain-attack-vectors) room covers what each format makes possible and how to inspect them.

## **Paradigm 2: Calling Models via API**

Increasingly, organisations consume AI through **hosted API services** from providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, or aggregators such as OpenRouter. You send a prompt, the provider runs inference, and you receive a response. You never touch the model file.

This might seem safer (no pickle files to worry about), but you are still trusting a supply chain. It is just a **different** supply chain:

| **Supply Chain Element** | **Download Paradigm** | **API Paradigm** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Model weights** | You inspect/scan them | Provider controls them; you cannot inspect |
| **Training data** | Often documented in a model card | Often undisclosed or vaguely described |
| **Fine-tuning** | You control it | Provider may fine-tune without notice |
| **System prompts** | Not applicable | Templates from untrusted sources can alter behaviour |
| **Versioning** | You pin a specific file hash | Provider may update the model behind the same API endpoint |
| **Hosting** | Your infrastructure | Provider's infrastructure, shared, multi-tenant |

> **Key insight:** When you call a model through an API, you are trusting the provider's entire pipeline: their training data curation, fine-tuning decisions, hosting security, and update practices. You cannot verify any of these independently. The supply chain is still there; it is simply hidden behind an API call.

*Download paradigm: a model file (.pkl, .safetensors, .pt, .gguf) crosses your trust boundary and runs on your infrastructure.API paradigm: only a JSON response crosses your boundary, but the supply chain behind it is invisible.*

![image.png](AI%20SUPPLY%20CHAIN%20Security/image%201.png)

You now have a mental model of what an AI supply chain looks like: the components, the trust relationships, and how it differs from traditional software. But where, exactly, do things go wrong?

In this task, we will map out the **attack surface** for the download paradigm: the four distinct layers where attackers can strike. Understanding these layers will help you know what to look for when evaluating models, packages, and data sources. API-specific attack vectors, such as silent model updates and provider key compromise, are covered in the [Supply Chain Attack Vectors](https://tryhackme.com/room/supplychain-attack-vectors) room.

![The Four Attack Layers](https://cdn-images.tryhackme.com/user-uploads/69650d18bb3fe8c456972924/room-content/69650d18bb3fe8c456972924-1775119353830.png)

*Every stop on the supply chain route is a potential interception point. A sophisticated attacker does not need to own the entire chain. Just one checkpoint.*

## **Layer 1: The Model Layer**

The model layer is the most distinctive part of the AI attack surface. Attackers embed executable code inside model files that runs silently at load time, modify a model's architecture to trigger on specific inputs, or subtly alter trained weights to introduce hidden behaviours.

**Model Layer Attack Taxonomy**

The model layer is the most distinctive part of the AI attack surface. Attackers embed executable code inside model files that runs silently at load time, modify a model's architecture to trigger on specific inputs, or subtly alter trained weights to introduce hidden behaviours.

Not all model-layer attacks work the same way. Three distinct levels have been identified, and each behaves differently:

- **Serialisation-level:** Code hidden inside the file format itself, and executes when the file is loaded
- **Architecture-level:** Malicious logic embedded in the model's layers, executed on every prediction
- **Weights-level:** Learned values subtly altered to misbehave on specific inputs

> **Key insight:** Stripping executable code from a model file eliminates serialisation-level attacks but leaves architecture-level and weights-level attacks completely untouched. Effective defence requires inspection at every level. The [Securing the AI Supply Chain](https://tryhackme.com/room/securing-the-ai-supplychain) room covers the tools for each of them.
> 

## **Layer 2: The Dependency Layer**

This layer covers the packages and libraries your ML project depends on. Attackers exploit it through dependency confusion, typosquatting, and uploading malicious packages with professional-looking descriptions that hide malware.

## **Layer 3: The Data Layer**

Training data is the foundation of every ML model, and poisoning it is difficult to detect. [Researchers have demonstrated(opens in new tab)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=eiqrnVaeIw) that replacing as little as 0.1% of a training dataset with crafted samples can introduce a reliable backdoor without measurably affecting accuracy on clean data. For denial-of-service objectives, the effective threshold drops as low as 0.001%.

> **Note:** Data poisoning attacks are covered in depth in the [Data Poisoning](https://tryhackme.com/module/data-poisoning) module. This room focuses on the supply chain context: how poisoned data reaches your pipeline through untrusted sources.
> 

## **Layer 4: The Infrastructure Layer**

The infrastructure layer covers the systems that host, distribute, and manage AI artefacts. Attackers gain access to model or package repositories, inject malicious steps into CI/CD build pipelines, or steal maintainer credentials to push malicious updates under trusted identities.

## **The Compounding Effect**

These layers do not exist in isolation. A sophisticated attacker can combine techniques across layers. For instance, an attacker could:

- **Compromise an account** on Hugging Face (infrastructure layer)
- **Upload a backdoored model** with malicious pickle code (model layer)
- **Include a requirements.txt** referencing typosquatted packages (dependency layer)
- **Distribute a poisoned dataset** alongside the model (data layer)

A single download can trigger compromises at every layer simultaneously.

![image.png](AI%20SUPPLY%20CHAIN%20Security/image%202.png)

The attack techniques from the previous task are not theoretical; they have all been used in real attacks. In this task, we will examine five significant incidents from 2022 to 2025. Each one exploited a different part of the supply chain, and together they show the full range of risks you need to defend against.

> **The deception at the heart of supply chain attacks:** A model that looks trustworthy on the surface can hide malicious code inside. Don't judge a model by its star rating.

## **Incident 1: PyTorch Dependency Confusion (December 2022)**

On Christmas Day 2022, an attacker published a malicious package named `torchtriton` on PyPI, exploiting the fact that PyTorch's nightly builds depended on an internal package with the same name. pip's version resolution installed the attacker's public version instead. The package stole SSH keys, Git configuration, `/etc/passwd`, and up to 1,000 home directory files, exfiltrating everything via encrypted DNS queries. It persisted for five days before discovery.

## **Incident 2: Hugging Face Hub Vulnerabilities (2023–2024)**

Multiple security issues emerged on the world's largest ML model platform. In November 2023, Lasso Security found over 1,500 exposed API tokens, 655 of which had write permissions, allowing malicious actors to push updates to legitimate repositories. In 2024, JFrog identified approximately 100 malicious pickle-based models that looked legitimate, with professional descriptions and real ML functionality, while silently executing attacker code at load time. The [Supply Chain Attack Vectors](https://tryhackme.com/room/supplychain-attack-vectors) room examines exactly how.

## **Incident 3: Ultralytics Build Pipeline Compromise (December 2024)**

Attackers injected malicious code into the GitHub Actions build workflow for Ultralytics, the organisation behind the widely used YOLO object detection library. The compromise caused a cryptominer to be embedded into published PyPI packages, meaning developers who ran a standard `pip install` received the malicious version. The attack targeted the built infrastructure rather than the source code directly.

## **Incident 4: @solana/web3.js Compromise (December 2024)**

Attackers stole a maintainer's npm credentials and published two backdoored versions of a widely-used package, exfiltrating cryptocurrency private keys from wallet holders. Estimated losses reached **$130,000–$184,000** in the hours before detection. Though not AI-specific, the pattern is identical to what AI supply chains face: trusted identity, upstream compromise, victims who did nothing wrong.

## **Incident 5: NullifAI Scanner Evasion on Hugging Face (February 2025)**

ReversingLabs researchers discovered that deliberately corrupted pickle files could bypass Hugging Face's automated security scanners entirely while still executing malicious code when loaded by a developer. The technique exploited edge cases in how scanners parse malformed pickle structures, meaning a model could pass all platform-level checks and still be dangerous.

Now it is your turn to practise evaluating models the way you will encounter them in real life: **on repository pages**.

Click the **View Site** button below. You will see a realistic Hugging Face model page, a similar interface to what you would use when browsing for models.

View Site

**Your scenario:** You are a developer at a startup. Your team lead found a sentiment analysis model (`trustworthy-ai-models/bert-sentiment-classifier`) and wants to deploy it to production. Before you run `pip install` and `model.load()`, you need to evaluate whether it is safe to do so.

The page opens on the **Model Under Review**: the one your team lead wants to use. Explore it as you would any model repository:

1. **Model Card tab**: Read the documentation. Note whether it is thorough or sparse.
2. **Files tab**: Examine the model weight format. Check for any warnings.
3. **Security tab**: Hugging Face now shows automated security scan results. Review what the scanner found.
4. **Sidebar**: Check the organisation, download count, and creation date.
5. **Community tab**: Check for discussions or warnings from other users.

Then click **"Compare: Verified Model"** to see what a legitimate, trustworthy model looks like. This is `google-bert/bert-base-uncased`, one of the most widely used models on Hugging Face, from a verified organisation with a 6+ year track record.

**Compare these signals between the two models:**

| **Signal** | **Suspicious Model** | **Legitimate Model (baseline)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Organisation** | Verified? When did this account join? | Verified, established track record |
| **Downloads** | How many last month? | Millions of downloads |
| **File format** | Pickle or SafeTensors? | SafeTensors |
| **Security scan** | Any issues flagged? | No issues found |
| **Model card** | Thorough or sparse? | Thorough, with training data and limitations documented |

After exploring both, answer the questions below. Then ask yourself: **would you approve the first model for production?**

![image.png](AI%20SUPPLY%20CHAIN%20Security/image%204.png)

![image.png](AI%20SUPPLY%20CHAIN%20Security/image%205.png)

The attacks in this room share a common thread. The `torchtriton` package stole keys from developers who ran a routine installation command. The malicious models on Hugging Face performed their advertised ML task correctly while silently connecting to servers controlled by attackers. The Solana package compromise lasted only hours but caused six-figure losses. **None of these attacks required breaking into anything**. In each case, the victim trusted a component that had earned that trust, and that trust was the vulnerability.

That is what makes supply chain attacks particularly hard to defend against. The malicious models JFrog found on Hugging Face were not obviously wrong. They had professional model cards, plausible organisation names, and real functionality (they performed their advertised task correctly). They passed every informal check an ML engineer would reasonably run. The compromise was invisible until anomalous network connections surfaced, sometimes weeks later.

**Key takeaways from this room:**

- **Model files are code in disguise.** Pickle-based models execute at load time; format choice determines your exposure.
- **The four attack layers are distinct.** Model, dependency, data, and infrastructure attacks require different defences and produce different forensic signals.
- **Transitive dependencies silently expand your attack surface.** You are responsible for every package pip installs, not just the ones you listed.
- **Automated scanners are not a complete defence.** The NullifAI case shows that malformed files can pass platform checks while remaining executable.
- **Infrastructure compromise beats content filtering.** Stolen credentials on a trusted repository push malicious code with full legitimacy; no tooling flags it at download time.
- **SafeTensors eliminates serialisation-level attacks.** It does not eliminate architecture-level or weight-level attacks; the format is a single control, not a complete solution.
